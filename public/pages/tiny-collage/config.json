  "description": "Photo paper, Cardstock, Postcard.\n\nAnother one of Ms. Magdalene Lam’s creations, the Tiny Collage features notable moments from Ms. Lam’s teenage-early adult life. Highlights include: a photograph of the Raffles Junior College’s debate team (featuring Mr. Jonathan Yap and Mr. Lee Ningkai), a postcard from the Maid of the Mist (Niagara Falls) that Ms. Lam acquired after taking the New York Bar Exam, and a nametag from the European Law Moot Court held in Barcelona, Spain, where she served as a coach for the Columbia Law School Team (the only American team, that also made it to the semi-finals but dropped out because the competition was taking place during the finals period).",
