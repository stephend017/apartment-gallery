  "description": "Collage on cardstock and photo paper.\n\nThe centerpiece of this collage is a portrait of the male tenant of this residence, Stephen E. Davis. Born on August 6, 1999, in Baltimore, Maryland, Mr. Davis is a highly divisive figure due to his penchant for imitating a Singaporean accent and claiming he came from “the hood,” even though he is a red-blooded Ohioan. This collage is a testament to what Mr. Davis enjoys: coffee, restaurants, animals, America and technology.\n\nThis collage was designed by Magdalene Lam, as a gift to Stephen E. Davis for finally starting to frame all the prints they have collected since pre-union.",
