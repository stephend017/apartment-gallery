  "description": "Poster paper.\n\nAn avid fan of museums, Mr. Ryan J. Chen acquired this piece on a recent trip to the Poster House in New York City. This was a gift from Mr. Chen to Ms. Magdalene Lam, whose immense love for animals has resulted in the residence turning into a part-time zoo, part-time home. This poster is part of the series “Blazing A Trail: Dorothy Waugh’s National Parks Posters” that was on display at Poster House NYC from September 2025 to February 2026.",
