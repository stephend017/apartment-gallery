  "description": "Print paper.\n\nMs. Magdalene Lam acquired this piece pre-union, during a stroll around the Union Square Farmers’ Market. Ms. Lam thought it highly humorous to own a piece that so heavily emphasizes her two biggest flaws: being unable to use chopsticks properly as an ethnically Chinese woman; and abstaining from most types of seafood even though her country’s national dish is the Chili Crab (debatable). \n\n",
