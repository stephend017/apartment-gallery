  "description": "Print paper.\n\nMs. Magdalene Lam and Mr. Stephen Davis acquired this piece at the FAD Market in Chelsea. A lover of dumplings and now cats, Ms. Lam thought this would be a wonderful addition to their ever-growing collection of cat prints. This day was also a momentous one, because it was the first time Ms. Lam and Mr. Davis met Mr. Dan Sweeney, Ms. Sophie Low’s then-newfound interest.",
