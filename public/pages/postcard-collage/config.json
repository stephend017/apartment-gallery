Intending to showcase Ms. Lam’s relationships with friends, families and different countries, the collage includes letters written by Ms. Lam’s closest friends. Highlights include: a letter from Ms. E-Zen Tan to Ms. Magdalene Lam during her days in London; a picture of Ms. Lam from 2015 with Ms. Nursyaqilah Bte. Mhd. Ramlee; and a card from Ms. Rachel Lam asking her twin sister to “enjoy the soaps and shit.”",
