  "description": "Poster\n\nMr. Stephen Davis acquired this work in 2025 as a gift to Ms. Magdalene Lam. As a member of the Jewish community (by blood, not choice) Mr. Stephen Davis has been making bagels at home since he moved to NYC in 2021. This became a way for him to embrace New York as a home and set the baking foundations for him to begin pizza making in 2024. ",
