This is the art that will protect your aura. Hello Lemon Zesty originally drew it to hang in their new art studio as a reminder to themself and to others that we all have the power to control our own moods. \"Please Take Responsibility For The Energy You Bring Into This Space\" is a nice way to say \"Don't bring your shit vibes near me.\"",
