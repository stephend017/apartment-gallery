  "description": "Print paper.\n\nMs. Magdalene Lam could have sworn this was another Mogutable print, but unfortunately, upon further research, Ms. Lam has no idea where this print came from. Ms. Lam was drawn to the print because of the sense of nostalgia it evoked; surprisingly including one of the only fish dishes Ms. Lam actually likes (Cantonese-style steamed fish). Also pictured in the print is a TVB drama currently playing on the TV, a throwback to Ms. Lam’s childhood and teenage years.\n\n",
