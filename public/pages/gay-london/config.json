  "description": "Canvas. On Loan.\n\nPainted by Mr. Lucas Forbes while they were living in their 260 Riverside Drive apartment, Mr. Forbes and Ms. Magdalene Lam decided to sporadically embark on a painting journey of the two places that meant the most to them (at that time): London and New York City. Unfortunately, Ms. Lam’s black-and-white rendition of New York City did not survive her multiple moves, but this masterpiece will remain a testament to a lost time in history (both metaphorically and literally).",
